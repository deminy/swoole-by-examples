# Swoole by Examples

[![License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY--NC--ND%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)

The repository is to help developers to get familiar with [Swoole](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src) through a 
variety of examples. All the examples are fully functioning; they can be executed and verified using the Docker images
provided.

NOTE: I'm adding examples for latest versions of Swoole, so please be patient.

## Setup the Development Environment

We use Docker to setup our development environment. Other than Docker, you don't need to install any other software to
run and test the examples: you don't need to have PHP, Swoole, Composer, or some other software installed locally.

We use [the official Docker image of Swoole](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpswoole/swoole) to run the examples. There are
tens of examples under repository [swoole/docker-swoole](https://github.com/swoole/docker-swoole) shown how to use the
image. Please spend some time checking it first.

Before running the examples, please run command `docker-compose up -d` under the root repository directory to start the
Docker containers. There are two containers used to run the examples:

* a server container where application servers are running.
* a client container where client-side scripts should be executed.

Both containers have the same PHP scripts in place, so most standalone scripts (e.g., most CSP programming examples) can be
executed from either container. Once the containers are running, you can use one of following commands to get a Bash shell
in the containers:

```bash
docker compose exec -ti server bash # Get a Bash shell in the server container.
docker compose exec -ti client bash # Get a Bash shell in the client container.
```

## List of Examples

* CSP programming
    * from blocking I/O to non-blocking I/O
        * The blocking version can be found [here](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/io/blocking-io.php).
        * The non-blocking version of the same script can be found [here](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/io/non-blocking-io.php). You can also check [this script](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/io/non-blocking-io-debug.php) to see how the non-blocking version is executed in order.
        * [This example](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/io/blocking-vs-non-blocking.php) shows how the _return_ statement is treated differently in Swoole. As you can see in the example, a function call could return a value back first before finishing its execution.
    * coroutines
        * create coroutines
            * [use different types of callbacks when creating coroutines](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/csp/coroutines/creation-2.php)
            * [use different functions/methods to create coroutines](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/csp/coroutines/creation-1.php)
        * enable coroutines
        * [coroutines in a for loop](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/csp/coroutines/for.php)

        * [benchmark](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/csp/coroutines/benchmark.php): In this example we create 1,000,000 coroutines in a single process; each coroutine sleeps for 5 seconds.
    * channels
        * [basic usage](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/csp/channel.php)
        * [class \Swoole\Coroutine\WaitGroup](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/csp/waitgroup.php) (like [the WaitGroup type in Golang](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup))
    * [defer](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/csp/defer.php)
    * runtime hooks
        * [configure and utilize different runtime hook flags in Swoole](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/hooks/hook-flags.php)
        * curl. There are two different ways to hook curl functions:
            * [Option SWOOLE_HOOK_NATIVE_CURL](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/hooks/native-curl.php) (recommended)
            * [Option SWOOLE_HOOK_CURL](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/hooks/curl.php): This approach is implemented through [Swoole Library](https://github.com/swoole/library); however, it doesn't work for _curl_multi_*_ functions.
        * The `mysqli` extension.
            * [hook _mysqli_ functions](https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/hooks/mysqli.php)
